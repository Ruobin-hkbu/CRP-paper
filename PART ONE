1.Between Skepticism and Collaboration: The Humanities’ Encounter with AI Poetry and Creativity
And now if the night is long enough
We’ll go our separate ways
I’m not sure he’ll never love me
                               --Charles Bernstein (with AI)

  In 2019, Charles Bernstein published his poetry collection Poetry Has no Future Unless It Comes to an End. What made this collection special was that it was co-created by Bernstein and an AI program trained by his own poetic corpus. Davide Balula, the programmer responsible for machine learning, referred to the program (and the machine had self-identified) as Bernstein’s “Synthetic Brother—a brother from another mother, ‘from another mother board’.” However, in the author column of the collection, only the names of Bernstein and Balula were noted, the “synthetic brother” was simply no where to be found. 
  Regardless of its thought-provoking, prophecy-like title, the poetry collection manifests something that is beyond the realm of mere poetry creation: it represents the intricate relationship between humanity and technology that has been disputed over centuries, or, in other words, humanity’s extremely conflict, painful and awkward attitude/treatment toward the rapid development of AI. On the one hand, AI is making an unstoppable impact on arts and literature, bringing enormous opportunities, excitements and inspirations to traditional ways of artistic creation, as well as the content of creation. On the other hand, questions related to human originality, authorship and authenticity are becoming increasingly urgent as AI continuously shaping and reshaping our reality, redefining creativity and challenging the concept of authorship. In the centre of all debates around AI lies a fundamental question: In the era of technological advancement, where exactly is the place humanity stand? Are we making machines stronger machine, or, are we becoming better humans? Looking into the future, how are we going to be better humans? In an attempt to answer the questions, this report will survey the shifting approaches and treatments within the humanity domain to AI poetry, AI-assisted poetics and finally, the challenges and transformative potential of human-AI collaboration in creative poetry writing. 
  
1.1Overview of humanities scholarship on AI-generated/assisted poetry
                Is the heart of AI a microchip or an algorithm?
              Or is the heart of AI human creativity?
                                   —Victoria Punch

The emergence of AI-generated/assisted poetry has been encountered with considerable skepticism and various controversies among humanity scholars, literary critics, and creative practitioners. Early responses to AI-generated contents and AI-assisted writing have often highlighted its perceived deficiencies, with detractors pointing to a lack of genuine emotion, contextual depth, and nuanced understanding in machine-produced verses. Critics have raised fundamental questions about authenticity, originality, and authorship, arguing that AI systems, reliant on pre-existing human-curated data and algorithmic recombination, cannot truly innovate or express a unique artistic voice. This skepticism is further compounded by a broader preconceived cultural bias against AI creation, frequently dismissing such works as derivative or inauthentic compared to human-created literature. Despite these persistent criticisms, recent years have witnessed a gradual shift in attitudes, as studies begin to recognize the potential for AI to positively influence literature and the arts. Increasingly, scholars are exploring how AI can serve as a catalyst for new forms of creativity and collaboration, suggesting that the relationship between human and machine authorship is more complex and generative than initially assumed. 

1.1.1Exploration of skepticism: studies on deficiencies in AI-generated contents, studies on questions about authenticity, originality, and authorship (1240)
This brief section starts with the question concerning why is AI subject to criticism and controversies in humanities. To answer the question, we need to explore the two facets of AI, firstly, the technology itself, the part which we can do to improve/change AI; secondly, the representation of AI, the part which human can reflect on but could hardly change. 
In 1956, Herbert A. Simon introduced the concept “satisficing” , a portmanteau of “satisfy” and “suffice”, describing the solution that is “good enough,” rather than the optimal or perfect answer, due to limitations in information, time, or cognitive resources. In terms of “suffice”, AI fulfill human expectations quite well for it could generate literary contents within seconds. However, studies have found AI-generated contents to be unsatisfactory, revealing an inherent technological barrier that are not yet to overcome. The most frequently mentioned unsatisfying element in AI-generated contents lies in its lack of depth and nuance. Punch (2024) concludes the ChatGPT-generated revision on her poetry that, “the AI analysis lacks nuance, focusing predominantly upon the poems’ themes.” Comparing AI-generated poems with human-written poems, Veremchuck (2024) also comes to similar conclusion that AI poems can “easier be unraveled,” which make them distinguishable from human-written poems. This persistent lack of depth and nuance serves as a reminder that while AI technology may suffice in meeting surface-level expectations, it has yet to achieve the complexity and authenticity intrinsic to human creativity. 
Aside from the “unsatisfactory” technology itself, the prevailing criticism also has to do with human psychology in response to AI literature in general. Stanko-Kaczmarek et al. (2024) report that the perception of authorship has a significant impact on evaluating the poems either generated by AI or humans, indicating a preconceived bias against AI-generated contents. The participants, while evaluating both AI and human created poems, tend to articulate nuanced perceptions and emotional responses influenced by their awareness of the creator’s identity as human or otherwise. The experiment reveals a deep-seated, preconceived bias against AI works, to which Huston and Schnellmann (2023) conclude as “an anxiety of machine influence” fueled by the unknown and the fear that artificial intelligence may one day replace or threaten the role of human authorship and originality, challenging fundamental notions of what it means to create and be creative. 
Now, what does an AI ‘authorship’ represent, other than a threat of rendering human creativity silenced, and what makes it so unsettling, so unsettling that Bernstein would unmarked his “synthetic brother” from the book? On a ontological level, AI literature is, at its very core, coding— an automatic combination of existing words, rather than genuinely creating. Tao (2024) observes that recognizing AI-generated texts as literature represents merely a secondary agreement about the nature and ritual of literary forms. The allure of code, in this context, reflects both an unwavering faith in technology and a tendency to revere its promise of certainty, which he coins as a “disenchantment of words, and the enchantment of code” ; On an epistemology level, scholars warn the danger of AI-generated context distorting our perception of truth and reality. In allusion to Saussure, Linardaki (2022) suggests that AI are one-dimensional signs; they involve just the signifier, without having a clue what a signified is. Elam (2023) notes that AI’s literature experiments are “failed” not because they do not meet the target of literary standard nor because of technological insufficiency, but because “it can make it harder for people to name or navigate their realities”.  
These intertwined challenges—technological shortcomings and deep-seated psychological biases—illuminate the complexity of integrating AI-generated content into the landscape of human creativity. As we continue to advance AI’s technical capabilities, it becomes imperative to address not only how AI can produce literature that is more nuanced, authentic, and resonant but also how to navigate the psychological and cultural anxieties it provokes. Key questions emerge: How can we shape the development of AI so that it better aligns with our expectations of satisfaction (both technologically and psychological satisfaction), bridging the gap between mere sufficiency and genuine profundity? And, on a broader level, how might we foster a cultural environment in which technological progress does not eclipse the unique values of human creativity, but rather complements and enriches them? Achieving harmony between AI advancement and humanity’s aesthetic and existential needs will require ongoing dialogue and critical engagement, ensuring that technology evolves in a way that serves, rather than supplants, the human spirit.

1.1.2Recent shifts: growing interests in exploring positive effects in AI-assisted creativity and poetics. 
   Amid all the bashes on AI arts and literature, there also has been a marked curiosity about its generative potential, particularly in fields such as creative writing and poetry. Rather than viewing AI solely as a challenge or threat to human originality, many researchers are now investigating how collaboration with AI might lead to new forms of creative expression, innovation, and artistic insight. This growing interest reflects a broader re-imagining of authorship, creativity and originality—one in which AI is seen not merely as a tool for automation, but as a collaborator capable of enriching poetic practice and broadening the possibilities of imaginative work. Such positive explorations signal a departure from earlier skepticism, inviting a reevaluation of the ways in which technology and human creativity can intersect to inspire novel poetic outcomes.
   In an attempt to justify and validate AI authorship and co-authorship, Murphy (2023) quotes Barthes’ ‘The Death of the Author’, and argues that the concept of authorship will be transformed for those works generated by AI and human in collaboration, in which Murphy coined as a “culture where discourse can be circulated without any need for an author”. In terms of creativity, Murphy turns to Miller’s view that creativity is itself a production of new knowledge from existing old knowledge, accomplished by problem solving, emphasizing the function-driven aspect and the problem-solving essence shared by both computational creativity and human creativity. Stojanovic et al. (2023) suggest that though AI has the potential to disrupt a writer’s originality, it may also introduce new ideas and content to a certain degree. The study implies that the collaborative use of AI as a tool by humans might represent an optimal approach, offering support and enhancement to human writings, directing and complementing the creative process. 
Despite these promising perspectives and the growing enthusiasm for AI-assisted creativity, significant challenges remain at the heart of this evolving human-AI collaboration-ship. The question of how to validate AI-assisted writing—ensuring its value within the broader literary landscape—continues to provoke debate. Deep-seated biases and anxieties about authorship, originality, and the role of the human in creative production persist, often hindering the acceptance of AI as a genuine collaborator rather than a mere tool or threat. As we move forward, the task ahead lies not only in leveraging AI’s strengths to enrich creative practice, but also in confronting these critical issues: breaking down barriers of skepticism, fostering trust in AI’s artistic contributions, and refining AI systems to become better, more responsive partners in the act of creation. This report aims to unravel these questions, exploring the nuanced difficulties and transformative possibilities that define the intersection of AI and human creativity.


1.2Role of AI As a Co-creator in Poetry Writing
   
    The marriage of poetry and AI isn’t at all a fresh idea. 
I’d like to start this section with the story of Ada Lovelace, who was the only legitimate child of Lord Byron and the world’s first female programmer. She made the very first attempt of merging poetry and machinery despite her mother’s relentless effort of divorcing her from literature and arts, things that were believed to had caused her father’s ‘madness’. 
The idea of combining poetics and algorithm fascinated Lovelace, in a letter to her mother, she referred to this merging as “poetical science.” Three some hundreds years later, Lovelace’s vision had came true. As early as in the 1950s, the world’s first poetry generator came into being. Within decades, numerous updated version of that generator followed. Now if you search “poetry generator” or “poetry co-creation program”, multiple choices and various platforms will be provided. 
AI poetry has became such a common sense that it hardly rings the bell in our head: What is so special about this combination? Why AI poetry? Why not AI fiction, AI play or AI prose? How did the two find each other in the first place? Was it all just an assumption coincidentally made by a programmer whose father happened to be one of the greatest poets throughout history? This section will, in an attempt to justify AI poetry and AI-assisted poetics, look deep into the special connection between poetry and AI, explore more possibilities of AI in assisting poetry writing, and identify a suitable path for human-AI collaboration in terms of poetry composition.

1.2.1Why Poetry as a Starter?  

       In poetic creation, the Apollonian principle of measure and exactness goes
hand in hand with the Dionysian principle of intoxication and ecstasy.
                                    — Janez Strehovec
     
People tend to define poetry as one of the purest form of human artistic expression and creativity, something vastly different from machinery operation which based on scientific approaches, logic, and reasoning. At the very core of this type of thinking is a deep-rooted idea that science and artistic expression are essentially incompatible. However, in terms of writing process, poetry composition could be viewed as a certain type of reasoning and problem-solving, while, according to Strehovec (2023), artistic creation “can be understood as a cognitive and goal-oriented activity. ” Strehovec’s study views poets as the role of a researcher and his/her writing process as a sophisticated labor of verifying scientific approaches to individual components of reality. It is, much like operating a program, a hard work that involves a series of rational, even methodology-supported procedures. 
When it comes to the presentation of a poem, Schober (2021) adds that the embodiment of poetry is often two-sided: On the one hand, many poems are highly formalized and sometimes even seem artificially constructed; On the other hand, poetry is probably the freest of all literary genres, not necessarily restricted to ordinary syntactical and grammatical rules. Linardaki (2022) also suggest that poetry incorporates a degree of arbitrariness, ambiguity and absurdity, while, according to Schober, “much of the decoding of ambiguity takes place on the level of reception, ” emphasizing a reader-centred interpretation in poetry. Schober further explains that while a poem can be presented abstract, absurd and ambiguous, there is also a mechanism inside each and every readers called “ambiguity tolerance,” which creates a psychological expectation of uncertainty in the poetry to be appreciated, providing favorable conditions for the development of AI poetry generator. Poetry does not necessitate the use of precise language, meaning and grammatical structures (at least not all of them in a single poem), the requirements for developing a computer program or a natural language processor for poetry would be much lower compared to, say, a fiction or prose generator. 
    In summary, while the unique characteristics of poetry—its tolerance for ambiguity, arbitrariness, and formal flexibility—create comparatively favorable conditions for AI poetry generators, the journey toward achieving truly compelling, resonant AI-generated poetry remains a challenging one. The technical threshold for producing a poem is lower than for other forms of literature such as fiction or prose, yet current AI systems still fall short in conveying the nuanced, layered emotions and deeply felt human experiences that define the art form at its core. The necessity to explore new avenues is urgent, such as fostering human-AI collaboration, in the hope of bridging the divide and unlocking richer creative outcomes. 
  
1.2.2Why Poetry Need AI, Why AI-assisted Creativity? AI as Idea Prompt, Style-developer, Diversity Explorer, and Mastery Imitator. 
   Why does poetry need AI, and what can AI-assisted creativity truly offer to the poetic process? Far from simply automating writing, AI introduces a spectrum of possibilities for poets and writers—acting as a prompt for new ideas, an engine for exploring diverse perspective, a tool for fostering personal styles, and even an imitator of poetic mastery. The integration of AI into poetry composition is not about replacing the human touch, but rather about expanding the horizons of creative exploration, challenging established norms, and providing fertile ground for experimentation. In this context, AI serves as both a collaborator and catalyst, opening new pathways for expression and pushing the boundaries of what poetry can become. 
   Firstly, AI could serve as an idea prompt and diversity explorer. Pretsch’s study (2023) manifested that AI’s inherent strength lies in the fact that it can draw from vast repositories of data, which means that AI can scan through thousands of poetic works by different poets, spanning styles, eras and emotions to produce new compositions. This might offer insights and emotional depth that rivals traditional human compositions, which regularly consists by a closed-system of personal experience, fixed style and poetic knowledge. On the other hand, AI’s very detachment from personal experience might grant it a unique form of creativity, without the biases, cultural impositions and emotional boundaries that often constrict human poets, which could explain why AI sometimes provide new inspirations for human writers. It makes people see what is totally opposite of human experience, cultural biases and ideological restrictions. 
   Secondly, according to Swathi (2024), with AI’s ability of quickly create contents customized to users’ preferences, it opens up new possibilities for a personalized, interactive writing experience, and democratize the process of creating poetry. Swathi’s study hints at the possibility of AI pushing poetry to de-professionalization—the removal of barriers for amateurs, and personalization—a customization of style and expression. 
   Thirdly, AI could be trained as a mastery imitator. The essence of AI is situational simulation and imitation of human intelligent behaviour. Many people believe that AI imitation is a plagiarism of human poetic data and existing poetry form and style. However, this study believes that AI imitation is a mimic of human intelligent behavior and roles, and a simulation of context and writing situation. A former study Using AI for Dialoguing with Texts: From Psychology to Cinema and Literature (2023) offers an in-depth exploration of how artificial intelligence can mediate human engagement by imitating and simulating different roles and characters within a literary texts. this work positions AI as both a tool and a partner for scholars, critics, and creators alike, advocating for a methodological pluralism that can more fully unlock the interpretive richness of cultural texts. Based on this previous experiment, this study believes that AI can also play different roles in the process of writing poetry, such as assistant, guide, and even imitate the style and writing ideas of masters, bringing different experiences to users and creating different writing atmospheres.
   In summary, the integration of AI into the realm of poetry offers remarkable opportunities for innovation and expanded creative engagement. By serving as a prompt for new ideas, a facilitator of diverse perspectives, and a skilled imitator of poetic mastery, AI has proven to be a valuable catalyst and collaborator in the creative process. Its ability to transcend the limitations of individual experience and introduce fresh angles and possibilities enriches poetic expression and invites both amateurs and professionals to explore new dimensions of writing. Nevertheless, as we embrace these advancements, it is essential to acknowledge the need for clear boundaries and thoughtful regulations to guide AI’s involvement in poetic creation. These measures will help ensure that the integration of AI remains ethical, respectful of artistic integrity, and supportive of genuine human creativity—a discussion that will be explored in greater detail in later sections. 

1.2.3How to make AI a collaborator, not a replacement—supporting, prompting, inspiring: Establishing self-efficacy and human-centred mindset in the process
  
To truly harness AI’s potential, it is crucial to position the technology as a
collaborator—one that prompts, supports, and inspires, rather than replaces, human creativity. Embracing human-AI collaboration not only preserves the unique emotional and imaginative capabilities of the poet, but also recognizes the value of self-efficacy and a human-centred mindset. By encouraging dialogue and interplay between human intuition and AI-driven experimentation, we can cultivate a creative process that is both innovative and authentically personal, highlighting the irreplaceable role of human agency in shaping the future of AI-assisted poetry. 
   McQuire et al. (2024) highlight the significance of establishing self-efficacy in creative collaboration with AI. The study examines how the design of generative AI influences human creativity in poetry writing and finds that people’s engagement declines when receiving a poem generated by AI and attempting to edit it. However, the creativity deficit dissipates when participants co-create with—not edit—AI and establish self-efficacy as an important mechanism in this process. Based on McQuire’s study, this research asks a further question in terms of using AI tool in collaboration, that is how to transit poetry writing from a functional sphere to creative sphere: functional writing is a target-based writing while the users’ are asked to co-write a poem with AI program, creative poetry composition, however, is a spontaneous act of artistic expression using AI as a furnishing tool or an inspiration, the difference between the two lies in the creative motivation inspired within the user. Whether and how AI can be trained to trigger creative motivation and help users develop creative awareness is what this study aims prime. 
     Human-centred mindset is a concept articulated in UNESCO’s AI Competency Framework for Education (2024), highlighting a human-centred approach in human-AI collaboration. The approach encompasses a few core principles, including the use of AI must be at the service of strengthening human capacities and sustainable development and that the selection, use and monitoring of the impact of AI must be human-controlled and human accountable. The most intuitive manifestation of this human-centered mindset in AI-assisted poetry writing is to consider what human users/students gain from this process: for example, they acquire a better understanding of poetics in general, learned different poetry expression techniques, become more adept at using AI to assist in expressing artistic experience, and learned to discern and appreciate co-created poetic outputs. How can program developers and AI fine-tuners control and monitor the impact of AI on human users and try to make users benefit more in the writing process? This is also an essential research question to be discussed in this study. 
As we move forward, embracing a human-centred mindset becomes essential for unlocking the full benefits of AI in artistic and educational contexts. The real value lies not simply in what AI can produce, but in how its thoughtful use can inspire, empower, and develop human capability. This calls for intentional design, continuous oversight, and a strong commitment to self-efficacy, emphasizing the human gains from every interaction with AI. By prioritizing these principles, future research and practice can ensure that AI serves as a true partner in creative growth, nurturing not only technical skill but also deeper artistic awareness, confidence, and autonomy in its users. 
       
1.3Incorporating Human Decisions and Critical Engagement During the Process (Methodology guideline)

They may be called poetry by that figure of speech which considers the effect as a synonym of the cause. But poetry in a more restricted sense expresses those arrangements of language, and especially metrical language, which are created by that imperial faculty, whose throne is curtained within the invisible nature of man.
                                       —Percy Bysshe Shelley
   We’ve discussed AI’s role as a co-creator in relation to their human counterpart in previous section, exploring possibilities of fostering and strengthening a human-centred collaboration. This section, however, focuses on poetry, as an artisitc expression, a concept, and a community: What’s the future going to be like when poetry “comes to an end” ? Why we still need human poets in the process? What are the things that are unique to human poets that must be preserved and be fed to the machine?
   I’d like to start this section with Percy Bysshe Shelley’s “A Defense of Poetry,” in which Shelley defines poetry as a formidable force shaped by the “invisible nature of man.” The “invisible” mentioned by Shelley is worthwhile contemplating. All we know is that AI shines at capturing the very essence, the obvious treats, and characteristics of things and the visible connections among objects. In terms of poetry, sometimes, it is the “ineffable”, the incommunable, and the private that truly matters, that truly resonates with the audience. Therefore, in the process of AI-assisted creation, we should not emphasize what choices the machine makes, what kind of words, forms, and styles it choose to generate, but focus on observing each and every decisions and critical judgement made by human users, what they’ve decided to keep and discard from observing AI-generated results. Often, these choices and judgement are the precious private human experience and incommunable emotional segments that need to be analyzed and studied.

1.3.1The irreducibility of human decisions in the AI-assisted writing process: The untranslatable, the incommunable, and deeply private aspect of poetic expression. 

   One of the primary challenges faced by AI programs such as ChatGPT in arts and humanities is grasping context and nuances in human language (Punch, 2024; Rane and Choudhary, 2024). The “context” problem comes from the fact that AI cannot capture the microscopic connections between things, so humans need to constantly input new data and the correlation between data to its database. As long as the input is  adequate (Wang et al. 2024), AI would, in a certain degree, appears to have capture the contextual message within a texts, and generate contextualized information. What is really difficult to solve is the problem of “nuance”. 
First of all, we need to find out what causes the nuance aspect in a poem. According to The New Book of Forms, there are four essential levels of poetry, which forges an integrated framework for understanding, teaching, and crafting poetry, illustrating that a poem’s power lies not in any single element but in the interplay between what is seen, heard, felt, and understood. The four layers are: the typographical, the sonic, the sensory, and the ideational. The typographical level refers to the poem’s physical appearance on the page—the arrangement of lines, stanzas, and visual elements. The sonic level encompasses the sounds of the poem, including rhythm, meter, rhyme, and other auditory qualities that give poetry its musical character. The sensory level addresses imagery and the evocation of the five senses, creating vivid and tangible experiences for the reader. Finally, the ideational level is concerned with meaning, emotion, theme, and the intellectual resonance of the poem. 
               
  The nuances of a poem usually posits somewhere during the transformation from typographical/sonic level to the sensory level, and from the sensory level to ideational level: First of all, certain language from the typographical/sonic level triggers or construct figures to the eye, to the ear, to the other senses, creating a powerful mind-picture; secondly, the whole experience of reading, feeling, and mind-picturing will arouse some deep, private inner emotions within the readers, for example, maybe he/she has also experienced something similar, or he has witnessed others experiencing the same thing; and this kind of resonance would eventually lead the ideationalize of the poem. Therefore, from a microscopic perspective, the subtlety and nuances of poetry is reflected in a conscious control and selection of the precise words and specific figure of language from the level of typographical/sonic level to the sensory level; From a macroscopic view, the divergence of poetic nuance emerges from authentic experience and a power of reconstructing that experience as a whole. Prestch (2023) concludes that human-authored poems, anchored in authentic experience often possess a raw emotional grangularity—the subtle interplay of primary emotions with complex feelings like nostalgia, remorse or anticipation. 
  

   What is particularly important in this nuanced transformation is the role of human decision-making—both exclusive and inclusive—in shaping poetic subtleties. Exclusive decision-making refers to the poet’s conscious process of narrowing down choices, often sifting through countless alternatives—whether generated by their own intuition or by an AI assistant—until the perfect word, image, or phrase is selected. This decision-making is rooted in individuality, context, and a sensitivity to the poem’s evolving tone and resonance. For example, among many synonyms suggested by an AI, the poet might exclude all but the single word that resonates with a personal memory or the precise shade of emotion they wish to convey, thus creating a layer of nuance that is uniquely human. Conversely, inclusive decision-making involves the deliberate incorporation and intellectual integration of varied possibilities, sometimes embracing the unpredictable or unfamiliar outputs from AI. In this mode, human agency is exercised by weaving together disparate elements—some generated by machines, others drawn from lived experience—into a complex, intellectually satisfying tapestry. Here, the poet acts as both curator and creator, blending machine insight with emotional intuition, and often arriving at previously unimagined combinations that enrich the poem’s expressiveness.
Yet, these nuanced decisions—the moments when a poet chooses to exclude, include, or transform options—are subtle and easily lost if not recorded or reflected upon. Only by documenting these micro-decisions in the drafting process can we truly capture the full richness and depth of a poem’s nuance. This record makes visible the interplay between human intention and machine assistance, revealing where a single word’s connotation shifted the emotional current or where an AI-suggested line opened unexpected thematic dimensions. Such documentation not only helps us understand the poet’s artistry but also exposes the limitations of AI-generated poetry. It foregrounds the incommunicable and deeply private aspects of poetic expression that cannot be reduced to algorithmic output. Ultimately, by tracing these decision-making pathways—both exclusive and inclusive—we preserve the irreducible humanity at the heart of poetic creation, and set a standard for future studies on human-AI collaboration within the literary arts.
1.3.2 Continued need for human critical engagement in “adding layers” to machine learning 

  This section aims at discussing how to incorporate human decisions and critical engagement into the process of human-AI collaboration. This study argues for a dynamic, continued, human-machine in-a-loop mode. It is through this active partnership—where the human user does not only select and refine machine outputs, but also adds interpretive, emotional, and structural layers to the program—that poetry moves beyond algorithmic recombination and attains true artistic resonance. This ongoing human involvement is not a supplementary stage but a core requirement for imbuing generative poetry with authenticity, depth, and meaning, highlighting that the evolution of poetic collaboration depends as much on human discernment as on technological innovation.
   This dynamic human-machine in-a-loop mode isn’t a fresh idea. “Can Human Assistance Improve a Computational Poet?” (2015) systematically integrates human input at multiple stages of the poetic generation process: First, a state-of-the-art text-generating model was used to produce an initial corpus of poems across various themes and forms; In the next phase, human participants—comprising both poets and non-experts—interacted with these poems through a standardized workflow: they reviewed the machine-generated drafts, selected preferred lines or stanzas, and made targeted revisions focused on clarity, imagery, and emotional nuance. To quantify the effect of human intervention, both original and human-enhanced poems were then evaluated by independent raters using a set of qualitative criteria, including coherence, creativity, and emotional impact. This iterative, human-in-the-loop process not only allowed for a controlled comparison between computational and collaboratively refined outputs, but also highlighted specific points in the workflow where human decisions contributed most to poetic quality. The method was further defined by Lamb et al. (2017) as “human enhancement,” which refers to the ways in which human creativity, interpretation, and decision-making elevate and refine the output of generative systems. Rather than reducing the human role in opposed to what “machine enhancement” is aiming at, generative techniques rely on poets to guide, curate, and shape machine-generated material, infusing it with intention, nuance, and authentic voice. 
  However, the methodology employed by Lamb et al. raises important questions about the nature of the collaboration. Specifically, it remains ambiguous whether humans are primarily assisting the machines, or vice versa. This prompts a further issue: how can we ensure that human users are also progressing through their engagement with computational poetry? As participants interact with and refine machine-generated texts, their own decision-making abilities, poetic literacy, and creative capacities may evolve as well. The challenge, then, lies in designing processes that foster mutual advancement—where both human judgment and machine learning develop in tandem, rather than simply privileging one over the other. Therefore, this study aims to move beyond the paradigm of “human enhancement”, instead prioritizing the development of human participants’ abilities. By emphasizing how machines can better serve and enhance human creativity, this approach seeks to explore new and more effective models of human-machine collaboration.
